[CQFN](https://github.com/cqfn)
is the place where we keep experimental
and not-yet-ready-for-production open source products.
Even though our projects are experimental we expect their
authors to maintain them with the highest quality, according
to the best practices of open source community, including:

  * Your product must be _somehow_ better than others on the market
  * Your README must list all known competitors and explain why they are worse
  * Continuous integration is a must (use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions))
  * Static analysis is a must
  * Your release procedure must be automated either via [@rultor](https://www.rultor.com) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
  * [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) must exist
  * Your README must [look nice](https://www.yegor256.com/2019/04/23/elegant-readme.html)
  * Your membership in @cqfn must be "public" ([edit here](https://github.com/orgs/cqfn/people))
  * Your contribution discipline is [exceptional](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html)
  * Your license must be [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Use one of our existing projects as an example.
